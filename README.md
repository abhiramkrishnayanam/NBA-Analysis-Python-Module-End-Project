## Project Overview

### Dataset Description
The dataset is mainly about the National Basketball Association.
First it was read into a Jupyter Notebook and underwent various pre-processing and analytical tasks. It contains multiple features relevant to the analysis, which were preprocessed to ensure quality insights.

### Preprocessing Tasks

1. **Missing Value Treatment**:
   - Identified and handled missing values in the dataset using techniques such as imputation or removal.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Standardized column names and ensured consistent formatting.
   - Removed duplicate entries.
3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Applied encoding techniques for categorical variables.
   - Scaled numerical variables to ensure uniformity for downstream analysis.

### Analysis and Visualizations

Five key analysis tasks were performed, accompanied by visualizations:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**:

   - Computed measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range for numerical columns.
   - Visualized data distribution using histograms and box plots.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:

   - Calculated pairwise correlations between numerical variables.
   - Represented relationships using a heatmap.
   - Key Insight: Strong positive correlation identified between variables X and Y, suggesting a potential causal relationship.

3. **Category Analysis**:

   - Grouped data by Age groups and calculated aggregate metrics.
   - Created bar charts to illustrate proportions and distributions.


### Key Trends, Patterns, and Correlations
## Inferences : 
* "New Orleans Pelicans" has the highest percentage of players.
* Position 'SG' has the highest number of players and Position 'C' has the lowest number of players.
* Found that "25 to 30 " is the predominant age group.
* Highest salary is for 'C' position .
* The correlation between Age and Salary is slightly positive, that is When age increases the salary will increase in a slight manner.
* Team 'Cleveland Cavaliers ' have the highest salary.
